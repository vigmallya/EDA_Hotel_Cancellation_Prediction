### Introduction
In this analysis, I explored hotel booking data to uncover key patterns and factors influencing cancellations. By examining variables like lead time, ADR, deposit types, and customer preferences, I identified significant trends in customer behavior across different hotel types and seasons. The study highlights how pricing strategies, market segments, and room preferences impact cancellation rates, providing valuable insights for optimizing hotel operations. I also implemented predictive modeling to enhance booking retention by identifying high-risk reservations. This analysis equips hotels with data-driven strategies to improve revenue and customer satisfaction.

### Objective
The objective of my analysis was to identify and understand the factors leading to hotel booking cancellations, with the goal of developing predictive models to reduce cancellations and optimize revenue management. By exploring the relationships between various booking features and customer behaviors, I aimed to provide actionable insights that help hotels refine their pricing strategies, manage seasonal demand, and implement effective cancellation policies.
